\section{Abstract}
Recently, many companies use containers to run their microservices, since containers could
make their hardware resources be used efficiently. And the newest healthcare data exchange
standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) \cite{FHIR_home} has been implemented
in a container by IBM, Microsoft, and firebase. That is deploying the FHIR in a container is the
trend of the world. However, if the hacker gets privilege escalation of containers, then
such attacks would influence the host or the other containers. Therefore, this research would
analyze, implement, and protect the container escalation in healthcare data exchange system.
The container escalation would be inspired in a container and influence the host or the
other containers. The healthcare data exchanging system will take the FHIR to simulate
the real-world threat and purpose a secure solution to protect patient's privacy.

% ================ Motivation ================

\section{Motivation}
The Container is a virtualization technique to package applications and dependencies to run in
an isolated environment. Containers are faster to start-up, lighter in memory/storage usage
at run time, and easier to deploy than virtual machines. Because the container shares the
kernel with the host OS and other containers and deploys by a configure file.\\
First, we often used to run a docker container to host our services. For example assignments,
, servers and some services in the information security club at NSYSU(National Sun Yat-sen University).
However there are some threats to the container technique, such as "Dirty CoW" \cite{Dirty_CoW}
and "escape vulnerabilities".\\

Dirty CoW is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel. It is a local privilege escalation bug
that exploits a race condition in the implementation of the copy-on-write mechanism in the
kernel's memory-management subsystem \cite{Dirty_CoW_wiki}. It was founded by Phil Oester. We
were 16, the first year we had touched the docker container. We tried to use the Dirty CoW
vulnerability to take the root privilege of my Android phone.\\

Escape vulnerability is a subcategory of sandbox security. At first, security researchers often
need a sandbox to help them analyze malware, which prevents the malware influence researcher's
host OS. Nowadays, the sandbox not only is used in analyzing, but also used to execute a
normal application for an isolated environment. However, if the application could modify the
outside resources without the kernel permission. That loses the purpose of isolation. That
might cause the information to leak or the kernel is hacked.\\

Hence, there is a big problem about: "How to make sure my services are isolated and secure?" The
author of this paper is the leader of the information security club. He should maintain all
the services working perfectly. Moreover, we are an information security club. Therefore,
the security and performance issue is the top-priority requirement.\\

Second, to present the container security, we would take the medical system for
example.
The medical system is the most famous part internationally. Including face the COVID-19
in Taiwan, we do not have the local COVID-19 case in more than 250 days \cite{COVID19_CNN} .
However, the medical profession needs to renew the exchanging EHR(Electronic Health Records)
system these years. To protect the privacy of patients, and producing a high-performance
system to exchange the EHR, we need an easy deployment, effective runtime, and a secure system.
We have to do this research in this project.

\section{Related works}
This section will focus on (\RN{1}) \hyperlink{preliminaries}{preliminaries} (\RN{2}) \hyperlink{security}{containter security}, and (\RN{3})
\hyperlink{heigh_performance}{high-performance server}.

\subsection{Preliminaries}
\hypertarget{preliminaries}{}
\subsubsection{FHIR}
The FHIR is a standard for healthcare data exchange. The FHIR standard will be used in
in Taiwan in the near future \cite{MOHW_FHIR}. The FHIR will be used to provide the PHR
(Personal Healthcare Records) in Taiwan. Therefore we choose the most popular standard
"FHIR" for the target.

\subsubsection{Linux kernel features}
First, there are 4 basic features for the abstract containerization services in the Linux
environment.
The 4 basic features are: (\RN{1}) namespace, (\RN{2}) cgroups, (\RN{3}) capabilities,
and (\RN{4}) seccomp.

\paragraph{namespaces}
The Linux kernel provides the namespaces to perform the job of isolation and virtualization
of system resources for a collection of processes \cite{Road_Ahead}.
User namespaces can be nested; that is, each user namespace—except the initial ("root")
namespace—has a parent user namespace and can have zero or more child user namespaces
\cite{user_namespaces} .

    \node[draw=red!60, fit=(n_1)(n_2)(n_3), label=below:{Child UID}, scale=0.9] {};

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption[]{The nested user namespaces}
  \label{Nested}

\end{wrapfigure}
The nested namespace is shown in Figure \ref*{Nested}.

\paragraph{cgroups}
This feature can limit, account for, and isolate the hardware resource usage of a
collection of processes \cite{cgroup_wiki} .
The container could use this feature to set the maximum/minimum usage of hardware
resources, which could guarantee processes' resources using reasonability.

\paragraph{capabilities}
This feature divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into
distinct units. To performing permission checks, traditional UNIX
implementations distinguish two categories of processes: privileged and unprivileged.
Privileged processes would bypass all kernel permission checks, while unprivileged
processes are subject to full permission checking based on the process's credentials
\cite{capabilities} .

Take ping command for example. The ping needs to generate and receive ICMP packets,
and usually that's done using the "raw sockets" – a feature limited to root only
(CAP\_NET\_RAW). Because it could also be abused to sniff and disrupt other traffic
on the system. Moreover, we can set the capability to the file to get accessibility
to execute the file.
Therefore, when we set the CAP\_NET\_RAW capability to the /bin/ping, we could use
the ping command as your user.

\paragraph{seccomp}
The seccomp feature is that only some specified process could call some specified
system calls. We could set a policy of while some file be loaded, and we often use
this system call to enforce the whitelisting or blacklisting policy.

Second, there are 3 terminologies of computer science related to container security in
the Linux kernel. Which are (\RN{5}) mmap, (\RN{6}) Copy on write, and (\RN{7}) Race condition.

\paragraph{mmap}
This is a system call of mapping files or devices in to memory, which creates a
new mapping in the virtual address space of the caller process. Such that
the process could operate the instance of file in memory directly.
And some libraries are also mapped into the virtual address space to share and handle
the function call. Therefore, the processes could take the same view of libraries in
it's memory space.

\paragraph{copy on write}
This mechanism purposes of a resource being duplicated but not modified, it is not
necessary to create a new entry. Therefore the kernel can make callers share
the same memory resources. The mmap is a system call could inspire this mechanism
in above paragraph. When some processes request same memory resource, the kernel
supplies the same memory page to callers.

\paragraph{race condition}
That is processes or threads are racing the same mutable resource. For example:
There is an accessible and mutable shared memory which be initialized as 0. And
2 threads or processes sharing that page. Consider one of the tasks is assigning
the page full of character 'A'. In the meanwhile, the schedular context switches to
the other task, which assigns that page full of 'B'. Then the schedular context switches
again to the first task. There is a problem now. What is the page for the first
task looked like? It does not meet the expectation for the first task.
This is race condition.

Finally, there are 2 I/O Linux system calls that would be considered to enhance the I/O
performance, which are the (\RN{8}) epoll and (\RN{9}) io\_uring.

\paragraph{epoll}
The epoll system call is a scalable I/O event notification facility, which similar
task to poll and select. Its function is to monitor multiple file descriptors to
see whether I/O is possible on any of them, which uses RB-tree to search the monitored
file descriptor.

\paragraph{io\_uring}
The io\_uring system call is a new feature in the Linux kernel 5.1. Which is also an
asynchronous I/O API, supplying larger throughput and lower latency. This system call
has 3 key elements: Submission Queue (SQ), Completion Queue (CQ), and Submission Queue
Entries (SQE).

When we operate the io\_ring, we should use the mmap to share the memory page from
the returned file descriptor by the io\_setup. After the page is mmaped, we could share
the 3 key elements with the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel will pick up our submission
from the SQE and polling in the kernel thread. That is, we have no use for a system call
to tell the kernel that we want to have an asynchronous I/O.

After the kernel finishes the I/O operation, the kernel will put the index of the finished
file descriptor to the completion queue. The user could traverse over the CQ to pick up
the finished file descriptors, which also reduced a system call to tell the kernel we picked
it up.

Therefore, we do not required any system call on submission and completion in optimal.

\subsection{Containter Security}
\hypertarget{security}{}
\subsubsection{Study of the Dirty Copy On Write}
Delwar Alam, et al. \cite{Study_Dirty_Cow} show the race condition, and the mechanism of
"copy on write". "Copy on Write" is "a resource-management technique used in
computer programming to efficiently implement a "duplicate" or "copy" operation
on modifiable resources \cite{CoW_wiki} ." It often inspires when fork() or mmap().

\subsubsection{Dirty CoW demo code}
Let's analyze the proof of concept (PoC) of dirty CoW \cite{Dirty_CoW} .
The key to inspiring this vulnerability is the mmaped memory space, which is mapped with
the PROT\_READ flag. The PROT\_READ flag declares the page is read-only.
\lstinputlisting[language=C, linerange={87-89, 101-101}, firstnumber=87]{src/dirtyc0w.c}

It creates 2 threads, which would have a race condition of the mmaped memory space,
\hyperlink{madvise}{madviseThread} and \hyperlink{procself}{procselfmemThread}.

\hypertarget{threads_main}{threads in main}
\lstinputlisting[language=C, linerange={106-107}, firstnumber=106]{src/dirtyc0w.c}

In one thread, call a system call "madvise", would make the user thread gain the root
privilege to operate the protected page temporarily. And the flag MADV\_DONTNEED would
tell the kernel: "Do not expect to access it in the near future \cite{Madvise} ." Moreover,
this flag might not lead to immediate freeing of pages in the range. The kernel is free
to delay free the pages until an appropriate moment \cite{Madvise} .

\hypertarget{madvise}{madviseThread}
\lstinputlisting[language=C, linerange={33-39,45-48}, firstnumber=33]{src/dirtyc0w.c}

In another thread, open its memory resource file. This file is a special file, which allows
the process reads its memory by itself.\\

Then, we move the printer of file descriptor of the memory resource file to the mmaped
space. And try to write it. But the mmaped space is read-only space. We expected the
kernel would create a copy of this space and write the copy \cite{root_exploit} .\\
\hypertarget{procself}{procselfmemThread}
\lstinputlisting[language=C, linerange={50-53,61-63,67-71}, firstnumber=50]{src/dirtyc0w.c}

However there is a problem! There is another thread that is racing this page with root
privilege. If the schedular context switches the madviseThread to procselfmemThread, while
the adviseThread is calling the "madvise" system call. It would cause the
procselfmemThread to gain the root privilege from madviseThread to control the mmaped file.

\subsubsection{Container Security: Issues, Challenges, and the Road Ahead}
Sari Sultan et al. \cite{Road_Ahead} have derived 4 generalized container security issues:
(\RN{1}) protecting a container from applications inside it, (\RN{2}) inter-container
protection, (\RN{3}) protecting the host from containers, and (\RN{4}) protecting containers
from a malicious or semi-honest host \cite{Road_Ahead} .

The (\RN{1}), (\RN{3}), and (\RN{3}) issue could implement the protection by the software
based solutions.

For the (\RN{1}) issue, this paper recommends that
we could use the different capabilities and the LSM(Linux secure module). Take
CVE-2017-5123 \cite{CVE-2017-5123} for example. The vulnerability here is the third argument of
waitpid() system call didn't ensure that the user-specified pointer points to userspace
and not kernel space. Since unprivileged users shouldn’t be able to write arbitrarily
to kernel memory.

The solution of CVE-2017-5123 without update the Linux kernel is to insert a
LSM to the kernel, which monitors the runtime behaviors of system call. If any process
use the waitpid() with a pointer point to the kernel as the third argument, the LSM should
block the operation and raise a signal to the user.

For the (\RN{2}) issue, this paper recommends that we could use the
LSM, namespaces, and cgroups to limit the container. Take CVE-2016-8655 \cite{CVE-2016-8655}
for example. This vulnerability is a bug in net/packet/af\_packet.c. We often use the
CAP\_NET\_RAW namespace in the container to make unprivileged user could use some privileged
net-util commands. The bug is there exist a race condition probability to race the unauthorized
data inside packet\_set\_ring() and packet\_setsockopt() \cite{CVE-2016-8655-lwn} . Such that,
there is a chance to modify the socket version to TPACKET\_V1 before the packet\_set\_ring
function. However, which would be kfree the timer in the TPACKET\_V1. We can take the timer,
which is used after free, to control the SLAB adopter to write the st\_uid by itself
\cite{AF_PACKET} .

For the (\RN{3}) issue, take the Dirty CoW vulnerability for example, which is exploitation
from the Linux kernel, the vulnerability could change the victim container to a privileged
container. Therefore, we should protect the host from the container, which belongs to type
(\RN{3}) threat in this paper.

\subsection{High-performance Server}
\hypertarget{heigh_performance}{}
This section will study some I/O performance and caching issues. Because the medical
data exchange system demands the stringent specification of the response time.
The I/O is the most often causing the bottleneck in the low latency required system.
To support a high-performance system, we can design a module to control the throughput
intelligently, and use the cache-friendly architecture to minimize the latency.

\subsubsection{PINE: Optimizing Performance Isolation in Container Environments}
Youhuizi Li et al. \cite{Optimizing} introduce a high throughput and low latency module to control
the I/O streams. Which implement a module to accord calculated optimization parameters,
and check if the process throughput is satisfied or the 99.9\% throughput is satisfied.

That is if the throughput reached the bottleneck, then the model would extend the
bandwidth by the cgroup. The latency evaluation is more difficult than throughput
evaluation. Youhuizi Li et al. \cite{Optimizing} used the statistical data to calculate
the 99.9\% of latency is in the margin of error in 3 standard deviations, if not the
module will raise the priority of the I/O queue.

\subsubsection{The epoll vs. io\_uring performance comparison}
\begin{wrapfigure}[8]{r}{.45\textwidth}
  % \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{io_uring.png}
  \caption{The comparison of do\_request function.}
  \label{Fig:iouring}
\end{wrapfigure}
The healthcare data exchange system would request for "small data" frequently.
Hence, the low latency has the priority over the high throughput in this project.
We often use the system call: "epoll" for asynchronous I/O with many files
descriptors, rather than sequential accessing those file descriptors in this scenario.
The figure \ref*{Fig:iouring} \cite{epoll_vs_iouring} shows the io\_uring could do request in fewer time
significantly.

  }
  \caption[]{The mapReduce model in this project}
  \label{Fig:model}
\end{wrapfigure}

% ================ Methods ================
\section{Methods}

This project would use the MapReduce model which is shown in Figure \ref*{Fig:model}.

\subsection{Study}
\subsubsection{Study CVEs and related mechanisms}
The Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel, which is over 28 million lines of code now(2020). There
are many mechanisms to solve real-world situations. Study those CVEs' related mechanism in the
kernel, might have more chance to find new vulnerabilities.

This project will study several container vulnerabilities for example: CVE-2016-8655
\cite{CVE-2016-8655}, CVE-2016-9962 \cite{CVE-2016-9962}, and CVE-2020-14386 \cite{CVE-2020-14386}.

And study some kernel exploit techniques \cite{Kernel_exploitation} because the container shares
the kernel. If I could exploit the kernel in the suffering container, it might have more chance
to influence the other containers or host.

\subsubsection{Study FHIR and related standards}
This project will implement the FHIR \cite{FHIR_home} data exchange system to demonstrate the container
security risk. Hence, we should study FHIR standard, JSON format (RFC7159), XML format (RFC4825), and
RESTful APIs.

\subsubsection{Efficient I/O with io\_uring}
This is a new asynchronous I/O API in Linux kernel 5.1 \cite{Efficient_IO_uring} . POSIX has
aio\_read() and aio\_write() to satisfy asynchronous I/O, however, the implementation of those
is most often lackluster and performance is poor. We will study and implement the new asynchronous
I/O API: io\_uring in this project to optimize the performance of the FHIR data exchange system.

\subsection{Container Security}
\subsubsection{Implement a simple container}
The Linux kernel supply some system calls to clone a process(also in thread) in their namespace
and group. We could implement a simple container by ourselves so that we can make a list of
vulnerabilities that may happen for which is shown in Figure \ref*{Fig:sc}.

\begin{wrapfigure}[15]{r}{.45\textwidth}
  % \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{Screenshot from 2021-02-09 19-45-29.png}
  \caption{The implementation of a simple container}
  \label{Fig:sc}
\end{wrapfigure}

\subsubsection{Aim a vulnerability and implement the PoC}
This project would find a vulnerability of privilege escalation in the container and affect
other containers.

\subsubsection{Implement the patch and pull request}
Being a security researcher, we cannot just only exploit the software, but also give patches to
the maintainer. Make the container technique more secure.

\subsection{FHIR system}
\subsubsection{Front-end}
This project would be designed a user-friendly interface. Make it easy to get data for the
patient and the patient's family. And make the exchange of patient's data between different
medical center confidential, integral, and available.

The interface would be designed as a website, which makes every user could access on different
platforms.

\subsubsection{Back-end}
This project would use the container technique at the back-end. It would isolate different
services in a different container. We would also design an access controller for variadic
requests, and design a high-performance kernel module to speed up the I/O and caching.

\paragraph{Access controller}
The access controller would be implemented as a kernel module. Because malicious user has less
probability to break the Linux kernel if this module has no bugs.
The access controller would use the whitelisting method to enforce the accessibility policy.
It would reserve the essential system calls in the container and discard all unused system calls.

\paragraph{High performance server}
This project would implement a kernel module for the high performance server. Which could hook the I/O
system calls from the web server. The module would replace the normal I/O calls with asynchronous I/O,
which could enhance the concurrency performance to provide high throughput.

Moreover, this project would design an efficient algorithm to predict and cache the container's
application data to reduce the latency, while backend server requiring data.

\subsection{System combination}
The last step is combining the FHIR system and container security. This project would demonstrate
an escalation of normal containers(ie. Docker) to steal patients' information from the webserver.
However, our container can detect and prevent a malicious user from escaping the container of the
web server.

Furthermore, the performance issue is also the key point in this project. We would provide a
high-performance FHIR system for the real world requirement. Therefore, we would also improve the
I/O performance at the final stage of this project.

% ================ Expected Outcome ================

\section{Expected Outcome}
This project will deploy a secure and high-performance FHIR healthcare data exchange system
in containers. We will demonstrate a container escalation and purpose an efficient mechanism
to protect the patients' privacy. Many companies publish their FHIR system in containers,
that make much medical organization easy to deploy. However, the medical organization might
not have a professional security software engineer to maintain the performance issues and
patients' privacy issues.

Therefore, this project would purpose a secure and high-performance solution for the medical
organization. We hope this could help they facing the future cyber challenges.
\paragraph{}
This project has 2 parts: the FHIR system and container security.
\paragraph{Container security}
We would implement a vulnerability PoC, patch, and demonstration for container escalation.
Because the container technique is the trend of these microservices. The healthcare data
exchanging center must use containers for quick deployment and management. Additionally, the
information security issue becomes more and more important these days. To prevent the
cracker breaks the healthcare data center and keep the patients' information is critical
today. We hope this research could make the container technique more secure, and provide
the healthcare data exchange system more reliable.

\paragraph{FHIR system}
We would implement the healthcare data exchange system with the FHIR standard. The implementation
would provide a high-performance service for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. The fifth-generation
mobile telecommunications is happening, and the sixth-generation mobile telecommunications is
coming.  More IoT devices will collect our healthcare data for medical demands, needing a low
latency server to digest the data. We hope this project could implement a high-performance FHIR
standard system, which makes data exchange effectively.
\paragraph{}
Finally, this project would combine these two parts into a container of a secure and
high-performance FHIR system. We hope this project could be the model role of healthcare
data exchange system of implementation in Taiwan.
