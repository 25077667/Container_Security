\section{Abstract}
A research of container's modern cyber security issue.
Many companies use container to run their microservices.\\
// FIXME: More info and more clear.

\section{Motivation}
The Container is a virtualization technique to package applications and dependencies to run in
an isolated environment. Containers are faster to start-up, lighter in memory/storage usage
at run time and easier to build up than virtual machines. Because the container shares the
kernel with the host OS and other containers.\\
I often used to run a docker container to host my services. For example: my homework,
servers and some services in Information security club at NSYSU.
But there are some vulnerabilities about container technique. Like "Dirty CoW\cite{Dirty_CoW}"
and "Escape vulnerabilities".\\
"Dirty CoW is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel. It is a local privilege escalation bug
that exploits a race condition in the implementation of the copy-on-write mechanism in the
kernel's memory-management subsystem"\cite{Dirty_CoW_wiki}. It founded by Phil Oester. I
was 16, the first year I had touched the docker container. I tried to use the Dirty CoW
vulnerability to take the root privilege of my Android phone.\\
Escape vulnerability is a subcategory of sandbox security. At first, security researchers often
need sandbox to help they analyze malware, which prevent the malware influence researcher's
host OS. Nowadays, the sandbox not only be used in analyzing, but also used to execute a
normal application for an isolated environment. But if the application could modify the
outside resources without the kernel permission. That loses the purpose of isolation. That
might cause the information leaked or the kernel be hacked.\\
Hence, there is a big problem about: "How to make sure my services isolated and secure?" I
am the leader of Information security club. I should maintain all the services working
perfectly. Moreover we are information security club. Therefore, the security and performance
issue is the top-priority requirement.\\


\section{Papers Review}
\subsection{Study of the Dirty Copy On Write\cite{Study_Dirty_Cow}}
In this paper show the race condition, and the mechanism of "copy on write".
"Copy on write" is "A resource-management technique used in computer programming to
efficiently implement a "duplicate" or "copy" operation on modifiable resources."
\cite{CoW_wiki} We often use the CoW while fork() or mmap().

\subsubsection{mmap}
// FIXME: Introduce the mechanism of memory mapping.

\subsubsection{Copy on write}
// FIXME: Many callers request same modifiable resources, and the kernel could use this
technique to enhance the performance of these callers.

\subsubsection{Race condition}
// FIXME: Processes or threads are racing the same modifiable resources.


\subsubsection{\hypertarget{dirty cow}{Dirty CoW} demo code\cite{Dirty_CoW}}
Let's analyze the proof of concept(PoC) of dirty CoW.(Oester, 2016)\\
The key of inspiring this vulnerability is the mmaped memory space, which is mapped with
the PROT\_READ flag. The PROT\_READ flag declares the page is read only.
\lstinputlisting[language=C, linerange={87-89, 101-101}, firstnumber=87]{dirtyc0w.c}

It creates 2 threads, which would have a race condition of the mmaped memory space,
\hyperlink{madvise}{madviseThread} and \hyperlink{procself}{procselfmemThread}.

\hypertarget{threads_main}{threads in main}
\lstinputlisting[language=C, linerange={106-107}, firstnumber=106]{dirtyc0w.c}

In one thread, call a system call "madvise", would make the user thread gain the root
privilege to operate the protected page temporary. And the flag MADV\_DONTNEED would
tell the kernel: "Do not Expected access it in the near future.\cite{Madvise}" Moreover,
this flag might not lead to immediate freeing of pages in the range.The kernel is free
to delay free the pages until an appropriate moment.\cite{Madvise}

\hypertarget{madvise}{madviseThread}
\lstinputlisting[language=C, linerange={33-39,45-48}, firstnumber=33]{dirtyc0w.c}

In another thread, open its memory resource file. This file is a special file, which allow
the process reads its memory by itself.\\
Than, we move the printer of file descriptor of the memory resource file to the mmaped
space. And try to write it. But the mmaped space is a read only space. We expected the
kernel would create a copy of the this space and write the copy\cite{root_exploit}.
\hypertarget{procself}{procselfmemThread}
\lstinputlisting[language=C, linerange={50-53,61-63,67-71}, firstnumber=50]{dirtyc0w.c}

But there is a problem! There is an another thread is racing this page with root privilege.
If the schedular context switches the madviseThread to procselfmemThread, while the
adviseThread is calling the "madvise" system call. It would cause the procselfmemThread
gain the root privilege from madviseThread to control the mmaped file.

\subsection{Container Security: Issues, Challenges, and the Road Ahead\cite{Road_Ahead}}
This paper has derived 4 generalized container security issues: (\RN{1}) protecting a
container from applications inside it, (\RN{2}) inter-container protection, (\RN{3})
protecting the host from containers, and (\RN{4}) protecting containers from a malicious
or semi-honest host.\cite{Road_Ahead}

The \hyperlink{dirty cow}{Dirty CoW} vulnerability is a exploit from kernel. But the benefit
of container and host OS are share the same kernel. This vulnerability can be used in
container to attack the kernel, and gives this application root privilege, changes this
containers as a privileged container or supervises the other containers. Therefore, we should
protect the host form the container(which belongs to type\RN{3} threat in this paper).

\subsubsection{Virtual machine and container}
// FIXME: draw the architecture of VM and container.

\subsubsection{Linux kernel features}
//FIXME: Introduce these features for isolating processes in Linux.

\paragraph{namespaces}\mbox{}\\
// FIXME: Namespaces perform the job of isolation and virtualization of system resources
for a collection of processes.\cite{Road_Ahead}

\paragraph{cgroups}\mbox{}\\
// FIXME: Limits, accounts for, and isolates the resource usage of a collection of processes.
\cite{cgroup_wiki}

\paragraph{capabilities}\mbox{}\\
// FIXME: Divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct
units.

\paragraph{seccomp}\mbox{}\\
// FIXME: Only some specified process could call some specified system calls.


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Study CVEs about the Linux kernel}
\subsection{Study related mechanisms}
\subsection{Implement the PoC}
Implement the PoC of known but not patched vulnerability.
\subsection{Implement the patch and pull request}

\section{Expected Outcome}
Would research some related vulnerabilities, and implement the PoC code.
Moreover I will generate the patch of the vulnerability(s) to protect these attack(s).
