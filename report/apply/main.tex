\section{Abstract}
A research of container's modern cyber security issue.
Many companies use container to run their services.\\
// FIXME

\section{Motivation}
The Container is a virtualization technique to package applications and dependencies to run in
an isolated environment. Containers are faster to start-up, lighter in memory/storage usage
at run time and easier to build up than virtual machines. Because the container shares the
kernel with the host OS and other containers.\\
I often used to run a docker container to host my services. For example: my homework,
servers and some services in Information security club at NSYSU.
But there are some vulnerabilities about container technique. Like "Dirty CoW\cite{Dirty_CoW}"
and "Escape vulnerabilities".\\
Dirty CoW is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel. It is a local privilege escalation bug
that exploits a race condition in the implementation of the copy-on-write mechanism in the
kernel's memory-management subsystem\cite{Dirty_CoW_wiki}. It founded by Phil Oester. I
was 16, the first year I had touched the docker container. I tried to use the Dirty CoW
vulnerability to take the root privilege of my Android phone.\\
Escape vulnerability is a subcategory of sandbox security. At first, security researchers often
need sandbox to help they analyze malware, which prevent the malware influence researcher's
host OS. Nowadays, the sandbox not only be used in analyzing, but also used to execute a
normal application for an isolated environment. But if the application could modify the
outside resources without the kernel permission. That loses the purpose of isolation. That
might cause the information leaked or the kernel be hacked.\\
Hence, there is a big problem about: "How to make sure my services isolated and secure?" I
am the leader of Information security club. I should maintain all the services working
perfectly. Moreover we are information security club. Therefore, the security and performance
issue is the top-priority requirement.\\
