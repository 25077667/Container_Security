  abstract  = {Many popular programs, such as Netscape, use untrusted helper applications to process
               data from the network. Unfortunately, the unauthenticated network data they interpret
               could well have been created by an adversary, and the helper applications are usually
               too complex to be bug-free. This raises significant security concerns. Therefore,
               it is desirable to create a secure environment to contain untrusted helper applications.
               We propose to reduce the risk of a security breach by restricting the program's access
               to the operating system. In particular, we intercept and filter dangerous system calls
               via the Solaris process tracing facility. This enabled us to build a simple, clean,
               user-mode implementation of a secure environment for untrusted helper applications.
               Our implementation has negligible performance impact, and can protect pre-existing
               applications.},

  abstract  = {Linux containers are gaining increasing traction in both individual and industrial use, and as these containers get integrated into mission-critical systems, real-time detection of malicious cyber attacks becomes a critical operational requirement. This paper introduces a real-time host-based intrusion detection system that can be used to passively detect malfeasance against applications within Linux containers running in a standalone or in a cloud multi-tenancy environment. The demonstrated intrusion detection system uses bags of system calls monitored from the host kernel for learning the behavior of an application running within a Linux container and determining anomalous container behavior. Performance of the approach using a database application was measured and results are discussed.},

  abstract  = {In multi-tenant environments, Linux containers managed by Docker or Kubernetes have a lower resource footprint, faster startup times, and higher I/O performance compared to virtual machines (VMs) on hypervisors. Yet their weaker isolation guarantees, enforced through software kernel mechanisms, make it easier for attackers to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of application data within containers.We describe SCONE, a secure container mechanism for Docker that uses the SGX trusted execution support of Intel CPUs to protect container processes from outside attacks. The design of SCONE leads to (i) a small trusted computing base (TCB) and (ii) a low performance overhead: SCONE offers a secure C standard library interface that transparently encrypts/decrypts I/O data; to reduce the performance impact of thread synchronization and system calls within SGX enclaves, SCONE supports user-level threading and asynchronous system calls. Our evaluation shows that it protects unmodified applications with SGX, achieving 0.6\texttimes{}-1.2\texttimes{} of native throughput.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing allows to utilize servers in efficient and scalable ways through exploitation of virtualization technology. In the Infrastructure-as-a-Server (IaaS) Cloud model, many virtualized servers (instances) can be created on a single physical machine. There are many such Cloud providers that are now in widespread use offering such capabilities. However, Cloud computing has overheads and can constrain the scalability and flexibility, especially when diverse users with different needs wish to use the Cloud resources. To accommodate such communities, an alternative to Cloud computing and virtualization of whole servers that is gaining widespread adoption is micro-hosting services and container-based solutions. Container-based technologies such as Docker allow hosting of micro-services on Cloud infrastructures. These enable bundling of applications and data in a manner that allows their easy deployment and subsequent utilization. Docker is just one of the many such solutions that have been put forward. The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast a range of existing container-based technologies for the Cloud and evaluate their pros and cons and overall performances. The OpenStack-based Australia-wide National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) Research Cloud (www.nectar.org.au) was used for this purpose. We describe the design of the experiments and benchmarks that were chosen and relate these to literature review findings.},
