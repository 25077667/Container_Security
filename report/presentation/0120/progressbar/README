Description
===========

This package allows you to easily visualize shares of total amounts in the form
of a bar. So basically you can convert any number between 0 and 1 to a
progressbar using the command \progressbar{<number>}. Also a lot of
customizations are possible, allowing you to create an unique progressbar on
your own.
