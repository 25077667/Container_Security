This research proposes
a mechanism, forces the system to call a specific policy in the container, is deployed in
runtime. This policy is designed for the FHIR healthcare data exchange standard's container, which
could guarantee the FHIR server to have only supported behavior and to takes almost zero overhead.
Recently, many companies use containers to run their microservices since containers could
make their hardware resources be used efficiently. And the newest healthcare data exchange
standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) 
\footnote{{FHIR official:  \href{https://www.hl7.org/fhir/}{https://www.hl7.org/fhir/}}} has been implemented
in a container by IBM, Microsoft, and Firebase. The deployment of FHIR in a container is a trend
in the digital world \cite{8473370}. However, containers are not sandboxes \cite{10.5555/1267569.1267570}
. Containers are just isolated processes \footnote{gVisor GitHub: \url{https://github.com/google/gvisor}}.
Therefore, if hackers or malicious software could sneak
into the container that would be a new cyber attacking surface in nearly future.
