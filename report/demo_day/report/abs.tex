This research proposes
a mechanism, forces the system to call a specific policy in the container, is deployed in
runtime. This policy is designed for the FHIR healthcare data exchange standard's container, which
could guarantee the FHIR server to have only supported behavior and to takes almost zero overhead.
Recently, many companies use containers to run their microservices since containers could
make more efficient use of their hardware resources as well as the newest healthcare data exchange
standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) 
\footnote{{FHIR official:  \href{https://www.hl7.org/fhir/}{https://www.hl7.org/fhir/}}} has been implemented
in a container by IBM, Microsoft, and Firebase. The deployment of FHIR in a container is a trend
in the digital world \cite{8473370}. 
Containers are isolated processes \footnote{gVisor GitHub: \url{https://github.com/google/gvisor}} 
instead of sandboxes \cite{10.5555/1267569.1267570}. Therefore, if hackers or malicious software could sneak
into the container, that would be a new cyber attacking surface in nearly future.
