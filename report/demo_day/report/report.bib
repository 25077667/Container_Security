  abstract  = {Many popular programs, such as Netscape, use untrusted helper applications to process
data from the network. Unfortunately, the unauthenticated network data they interpret
could well have been created by an adversary, and the helper applications are usually
too complex to be bug-free. This raises significant security concerns. Therefore,
it is desirable to create a secure environment to contain untrusted helper applications.
We propose to reduce the risk of a security breach by restricting the program's access
to the operating system. In particular, we intercept and filter dangerous system calls
via the Solaris process tracing facility. This enabled us to build a simple, clean,
user-mode implementation of a secure environment for untrusted helper applications.
Our implementation has negligible performance impact, and can protect pre-existing
applications.},

@article{KOZHIRBAYEV2017175,
  abstract = {Cloud computing allows to utilize servers in efficient and scalable ways through exploitation of virtualization technology. In the Infrastructure-as-a-Server (IaaS) Cloud model, many virtualized servers (instances) can be created on a single physical machine. There are many such Cloud providers that are now in widespread use offering such capabilities. However, Cloud computing has overheads and can constrain the scalability and flexibility, especially when diverse users with different needs wish to use the Cloud resources. To accommodate such communities, an alternative to Cloud computing and virtualization of whole servers that is gaining widespread adoption is micro-hosting services and container-based solutions. Container-based technologies such as Docker allow hosting of micro-services on Cloud infrastructures. These enable bundling of applications and data in a manner that allows their easy deployment and subsequent utilization. Docker is just one of the many such solutions that have been put forward. The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast a range of existing container-based technologies for the Cloud and evaluate their pros and cons and overall performances. The OpenStack-based Australia-wide National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) Research Cloud (www.nectar.org.au) was used for this purpose. We describe the design of the experiments and benchmarks that were chosen and relate these to literature review findings.},
