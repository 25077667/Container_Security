  abstract  = {Many popular programs, such as Netscape, use untrusted helper applications to process
data from the network. Unfortunately, the unauthenticated network data they interpret
could well have been created by an adversary, and the helper applications are usually
too complex to be bug-free. This raises significant security concerns. Therefore,
it is desirable to create a secure environment to contain untrusted helper applications.
We propose to reduce the risk of a security breach by restricting the program's access
to the operating system. In particular, we intercept and filter dangerous system calls
via the Solaris process tracing facility. This enabled us to build a simple, clean,
user-mode implementation of a secure environment for untrusted helper applications.
Our implementation has negligible performance impact, and can protect pre-existing
applications.},
