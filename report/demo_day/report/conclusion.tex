\chapter{Conclusion}

We can see the comparison results in virtual machine and container are
significantly indifferent order of time-consuming. There is no exist
the gVisor's result is because the gVisor was not able to launch the
IBM/FHIR server system, which is the target in our research.
We also expect the gVisor might run faster significantly than the virtual
machine, however, our target cannot be launched successfully in
gVisor's sandbox.

We thought there might have been some race condition bugs via JWE(JAVA Web
Engine) in gVisor. We found the IBM/FHIR server return an error code $141$
while it launching. However, we did the same configuration in Docker with
our policy and raw gVisor. Therefore, we thought the gVisor did not do
well to supports all system calls.

And the time complexity of the virtual machine is significantly different from
the container. We propose a hypothesis of the time complexity of the virtual
machine, because there are more page fault events and limited by the
throughput of virtual machine device driver\cite{10.5555/1267569.1267570,7095802}.
