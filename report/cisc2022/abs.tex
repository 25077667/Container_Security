    This research proposes
    a mechanism, forcing a system to call a specific policy in a container, which is deployed in
    runtime. This policy is designed for the FHIR healthcare data exchanging in a standard's container, which
    could guarantee the FHIR server to have only supported behaviors and to take almost zero overhead.
    Recently, many companies use containers to run their microservices since containers could
    make more efficient use of their hardware resources as well as the newest healthcare data exchange
    standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)
    %\footnote{{\href{https://www.hl7.org/fhir/}{https://www.hl7.org/fhir/}}}
    has been implemented
    in a container by IBM, Microsoft, and Firebase. The deployment of FHIR in a container is a trend
    in the digital world.
    Containers are isolated processes %\footnote{\url{https://github.com/google/gvisor}}
    instead of sandboxes. Therefore, this proposed scheme could reduce the
    risk of attacks in healthcare data exchange system without performance overhead.
